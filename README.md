# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the popular game tic-tac-toe using HTML and JavaScript
## How To Play:
1. Click on any empty box (denoted by an "O") to place your marker ("
X").</s>
2. The first player to get three markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, 
or diagonally) wins the game. If all boxes are filled without either
player getting three in a row, then it's a draw.</s>
